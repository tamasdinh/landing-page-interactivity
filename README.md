## Project goals

The goal of the project was to add crucial interactivity to a static webpage. Three key functionality was added to the starter HTML and CSS files:
- dynamically generated navigation bar
- pagescroll to relevant section if corresponding navigation bar item is clicked
- selective highlighting of active section (section that is on the screen)

## Getting Started

Given that this is a simple webpage development, there are no specific installation instructions. You can easily clone the contents of the repo by running

```git clone https://github.com/tamasdinh/landing-page-interactivity.git```

in your command line. This will download the entire repository to your computer, into a subfolder named ```landing-page-interactivity``` in the folder from which you initiated cloning. Alternatively, you can download the repo as a ```zip``` file from the repo page.

Once you have the repo, you can just open ```index.html``` in the repo root folder with your favourite browser and you can try out the functionality.

## Built With

* ```Javascript``` - Starting to grow on me :)
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) - Probably you already heard of it... Has incredibly useful developer tools built-in.
